This is a [quarto](https://quarto.org) html reporting template for sample size calculations at DCR.

THIS IS IN DEVELOPMENT:.

### Installing the extension

To install, type the following into the terminal and accept to install

```
quarto install extension CTU-Bern/quarto@html-rec
```

### Using the template

Once installed, you can create a new directory with all necessary files via the following command 

```
quarto use template CTU-Bern/quarto@html-rec
```

It will ask if you trust the author of the template (hopefully you do...), and then for a directory name. Type the path relative to your current location, for example

```
/Clinical studies/HtmlReport_9999
```
